<p>
What do you think is Lialina’s opinion of the word “user”?
</p>

<p><em>
 I think that the term user creates tension with regards to self-agency as our environments help shape and transform our very being. In addition, as the computer gravitates towards the form of the invisible, it is also almost natural for us to follow in its steps. Lialina suggests that the term user has the tendency to “depersonalize the people”. In this sense, if the “user” cannot interact with the technology, is she/he then useless? As designers we must acknowledge who we’re truly designing for…”We design for people, we don’t design for users”.</em>
</p>

<p>
What is Lialina’s ideal internet user? Provide some of the qualities that she outlines.
</p>

<p><em>
 Lialina’s ideal internet user reflective of the General Purpose User in coherence with the idea that “the network stays neutral or ‘stupid’. She then adds that, “For Norman, further generations of hardware and software designers and their invisible users dealing with General Purpose technology is both accidental and obstacle. For the rest of us the rise and use of General Purpose technology is the core of New media, Digital Culture and Information Society.” She refers to the ideal contemporary user as those who “can write an article in their email client, layout their business card in Excel… They can also find a way to publish photos online without flickr, tweet without twitter, like without facebook… even wake up at 7:00 without a ‘wake up at 7:00’ app.”</em>
</p>

<p>
From your own experiences interacting on the web— what is an example where there are “gaps that can be filled by users”?
</p>

<p><em>
I think that examples where there are “gaps that can be filed by users” are moments in which the power is reversed and we direct how we want to use a certain technology as opposed to conforming to its interface. In this case, if a gap were to be left we can then also apply ourselves. Lialina suggests that “a Universal User’s mind set means to liaise with hardware and software. Behavior that is antipodal to the ‘very busy’ user. This kind of interaction makes the user visible”. Filling the gaps would enable us to be more visible.</em>
</p>

<p><em>
While it is hard to pin point such gaps, I for instance used to only go on YouTube (pre-Google, pre-ads) in order to listen to some music. I would compile a playlist of videos and treat the website as a free mixtape. Though, YouTube now has only transformed since and is now also a streaming device for live videos as well as music.</em>
