		<p>In Hito Steyerl’s In Free Fall: A Thought Experiment of Vertical Perspective, Steyerl briefly defines the horizon as the literal dividing line of land/water and sky. The horizon in this case may also be used as a signifier of our incoming futures. The future waits for us as the horizon indicates where we can go, how far we have to go, even an estimated time of arrival. Although most notably, the perspective of horizontality—that is to look directly into the open world—generates an overall sense of position. By momentarily keeping still and having our eyes’ navigate through space, we’ve temporarily artificially stabilized the Earth, both consciously and subconsciously capturing images of time. We often refer to these images in our memory, and we refer to them otherwise as signifiers of the past. We store glimpses of time, often referring to them as anecdotal logs of experiences. The horizon in this case is a commonly used artificial tool that we refer to in the aids of representations of time and space, guiding us towards the construction of form and meaning.</p>

		<p>But the perspective of horizontality is now being accompanied with the perspective of verticality. Contemporary media and visual art is now being supplemented with aerial surveillance and/or drone generated imagery. For instance, technologies such as Google Maps and Earth has enabled a means of control and overview. By enabling the user the perspective of a standardized God’s eye view, one can only wonder: we’re probably not meant to perceive the world in this manner. The horizon disappears in an aerial perspective for we are simply looking at a ground. The ground acts as a barrier, like a wall that cannot be mathematically climbed. Since the vanishing point cannot be identified, the ground has now reverted back to its two-dimensional form and the viewer is this case appears as if he or she is floating. This becomes an act of looking down at yourself and acknowledging your existence, as if there were a barrier surrounding the world reflecting the image backward onto the Earth. Though to where there is a state of floating, there is also the state of falling. In the state of falling one loses all sense of orientation, where he/she has entered a state in which he/she no longer knows if they are beings or objects. It treats us as accessories and eliminates the aspects for which make us human.</p>

		<p>Panofsky also examined the state of comprehending representational space and the conditions that come with it. For instance, while visual perspective is extremely dependent on being able to see straight lines the fact is that our eyes are curved planes. What is true reality then? Homogeneous space then is never given space rather it is space produced by construction: as perception does not know the concept of infinity; from the very outset it is confined within certain spatial limits imposed by our faculty of perception. Within a homogeneous space, above is no different from below, left is equivalent to right and behind is inherently the same as ahead. A line is in fact a two-way street with two distinct points of beginning and end, rotating it though doesn’t change the path whatsoever.</p>

		<p>The current visual paradigm encourages the division of our world, whether that is through horizontal or vertical borders, and the fact is we’re almost conditioned to keep looking straight. How can we see the horizontal division of the world without an aspect of elevation? The act of looking down is only possible if one is elevated from the ground, or at the very least is in a position of power. We’re never reminded to look up, and why would we? We’re so distracted on the first floor by all sorts of things that we’ve failed to acknowledge the fact that a powerful few are constantly looking down at us. We can’t directly see this division, and so the division of vertical borders then can be manifested as a technological division.</p>
