		10. Mr Scarecrow
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: Peppa and George are playing at Granny and Grandpa Pigs’ house today.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Hello, Grandpa Pig.
</p>

	<p>
George: Papa ‘ig.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Hello, Peppa. Hello, George.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Grandpa, what are you doing?
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: I’m making a flower garden.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig and George: Oo-oo.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: These seeds will grow into beautiful flowers.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: I drop the seeds on the ground. Then I cover the seeds with earth.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Oh, where have they gone?
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: The seeds have disappeared.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: That’s strange. I’m sure I put some seeds here.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Yes, Grandpa. We saw you.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Well, they’re not here now.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Oh, well. I’ll just have to use some more.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: As I was saying, I simply drop the seeds on the ground.
</p>

<h2>ACT II: PARTY IN THE BARN</h2>

	<p><em>
Narrator: A little bird is eating Grandpa Pig’s flower seeds.
</em></p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Oy, get off my seeds!
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: So that’s where all my seeds went.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Into the little bird’s tummy.
</p>

	<p><em>
	Narrator: Two more little birds are eating Grandpa Pig’s seeds.</em>
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Oh, look.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Shoo, shoo.
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: What’s all this noise?
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Granny Pig, the birds are eating all my flower seeds.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: So we’re chasing the birds away.
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: There’s no point chasing them. They’ll just come back again. Look.
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: We need a scarecrow.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: What’s a scarecrow?
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: A scarecrow is a straw man that scares birds away.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: What a good idea, Granny Pig. I’ll make one. Come on, everyone.
</p>

	<p>

Peppa Pig: Bye-bye, little birds. We’re going to make a scarecrow.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: This is Grandpa Pig’s garden shed.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: There’ll be plenty of things in here to make a scarecrow. First, we need two sticks and some string.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: We’ll find them.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: Peppa has found some sticks. George has found some string.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Good. I’ll tie the sticks together to make the body.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: Granny Pig has found some straw and an old sack.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Lovely. I’ll put the straw in the sack to make the head. Now the scarecrow needs something to wear.
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: Here’s a bag of old clothes.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig and George: Woo-oo.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: George has found a dress.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Silly George. Mr Scarecrow doesn’t want to wear a dress.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: Peppa has found a coat.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Very good, Peppa.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: George has found a hat.
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: Very good, George.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Mr Scarecrow needs a face.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: That’s right. Would you and George like to paint a face?
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Yes, please.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: George paints the eyes and nose.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Peppa paints the mouth.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Fantastic.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: Mr Scarecrow is ready.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig, Granny Pig, Peppa Pig and George: Hurrah!
</p>

	<p><em>
Narrator: The little birds are looking for Grandpa Pig’s flower seeds.
</em></p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Look, the little birds are back.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Don’t worry, Peppa. Mr Scarecrow will scare them off.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: It worked. Mr Scarecrow has scared the little birds away.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig, Granny Pig, Peppa Pig and George: Hurrah!
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Good. Now my flower seeds will not be eaten.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Oh, Grandpa. The birds look very sad.
</p>

	<p>
Grandpa Pig: Yes, they must be hungry. That’s why I brought this.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: What’s that, Granny?
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: It’s a bird feeder.
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: Grandpa, may I have some seeds, please?
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: Come on, birdies. Lunchtime.
</p>

	<p>
Granny Pig: Now the birdies have their own seeds to eat.
</p>

	<p>
Peppa Pig: Hurrah! The little birds are happy again.
</p>

	<p>
Narrator: Peppa is glad that Grandpa Pig’s seeds will not be eaten. But she is even more glad that the little birds will not be hungry.
